# PostScript
## How to talk to your printer
You are looking at the guide accompanying a workshop about [_PostScript_][adobe:postscript].

PostScript is a [page description language][wikipedia:pdl]. It allows developers to describe precisely how marks should appear on a page.

We believe in learning by doing, so you can expect to be asked to open your favorite editor or integrated development environment and gain first-hand practical experience with _PostScript_, by following along this guide. Exercises along the way help cement your new found knowledge making you into a PostScript whisperer.
