# Reference Manual
This workshop is an introduction to the PostScript language. Although it tries to provide a thorough exposition of PostScript, the image model and its operators, it was never intended to be complete.

When you find the guide lacking the _PostScript Language Reference_ is the definitive source for all things PostScript. We provided a PDF version of the reference with the material. You can find it in the file `PLRM.pdf` or online:
