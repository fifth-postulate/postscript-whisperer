# Starter kit
If you want to try your hand on an interesting problem, without writing your own project, then this starter kit is for you.

```ps
{{#include ../../../example/spiral.ps}}
```

Create the above file and view it with a PostScript viewer. There is a spiral drawn.

Unfortunatly the spiral is fixed. The exercise is to create a procudure that draws spirals with these and other characteristics.
