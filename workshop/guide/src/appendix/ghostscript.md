# Ghostscript
In order to save trees, we are not going to send our experimentations to an actual printer. Instead we are going to use a PostScript interpreter.

Specifically, we are going to use [_Ghostscript_][ghostscript].

Ghostscript is a

> an interpreter for the PostScriptÂ®  language and PDF files. Ghostscript consists of a PostScript interpreter layer and a graphics library.

## Installation
[Obtaining Ghostscript][ghostscript:download] depends on your platform.

### Windows
The installation page has binaries for [Windows][ghostscript:download].

### Mac
There is a [homebrew recipe][homebrew:ghostscript] that can be used to install Ghostscript.

```
homebrew install ghostscript
```

### Linux
It is likely that Ghostscript is already installed, or that you can install it via a package manager. Otherwise the installation page has binaries for [Linux][ghostscript:download] as well.

## Verification
Once installed you can verify that Ghostscript works as intended by starting the program. There are various aliases notably `ghostscript` or the shorter `gs` should open a blank window and show the following prompt in the terminal

```

GS>
```

This can be used as a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). See the [Hello, World][book:tool:hello-world] on how to use that.

## Alternative
Ghostscript is a low-level tool that allows you to inspect PostScript programs and how they are interpreted. But often you will want to open a high level viewer.

Again, installing a PostScript viewer is platform dependent. Below we will provide some suggestions per platform

### Windows
[_psviewer_][psviewer] seems a capable PostScript viewer on Windows

### Mac
The default `Preview.app` has the capability to show PostScript files

### Linux
The utility `gv`, which stands for _ghostview_ and can be installed via a package manager, is a clunky, but good viewer. It has the option to watch the file you are developing for changes and update the display when changes occur.

## In case of emergency
If all the above fails, we have created a utility that will render your PostScript on the web:
