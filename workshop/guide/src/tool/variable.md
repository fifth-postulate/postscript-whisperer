# Variables
Up until now all the operands that we used are put on the stack from literal values. When we are working on larger projects that quickly becomes a hassle. In this chapter we will learn how to define variables that can be reused.

## Key
PostScript has a notion _key_. They are akin to symbols in Ruby. Keys provide a way to associate a value to a certain name.

You create a key by prefix a sequence of certain characters with a slash: "/". So the following code

```ps
/booster
```

pushes a key on the operand stack that is identified by the name `booster`.

## Definition
To associate a value with a key PostScript uses the `def` operator. For example the following code

```ps
{{#include ../../image-src/hello-world.variable.ps:1:1}}
```

associates the value `100` with the key `/size`.

## Lookup
When you want to use the value that is associated with a certain key, you can look up the value by using the name of the key.

For example, the result of the following code

```ps
{{#include ../../image-src/hello-world.variable.ps:1:1}}
size size
```

is that the value associated with the key `size` is pushed on the stack twice. In this particular case the top two items of the operand stack would be `100` and `100`.

## Benefits
The same benefits of using variables apply to PostScript programs as well as in other programming languages. Those include:

* **Readability**: A program that uses well chosen names can help in understanding code.
* **Reuse**: Instead of copying the literal value, variables allow you to reuse that value.
* **Adoptability**: When a value needs to change there is a single source of truth for it. This makes it easier to experiment with different values.
* **Maintainability**: Variables, when used to your benefit, serve as a form of documentation. They allow to show the intent which helps in the maintainability of code.

## Tip
An idiom that you often encounter in PostScript programs involving the `def` operand is the following

```ps
100 /size exch def
```

If you take a minute to think about the above code sample, you might come to the conclusion that it associates the value `100` with the key `/size`.

The reasoning could go like this: The literal value `100` is pushed on the stack first, then the key `/size` is pushed on top of that. The `exch` operator changes the order of the top two items on the stack. So now, `/size` is at the bottom and `100` is on top. Just like if we would have executed the following code

```ps
/size 100
```

The `def` operator takes the two items on the stack and associates the key with the value. In this case `size` is associated with `100`.

One place that you will use this idiom is when you have a long and involved calculation to produce a value and want repeated access to the value. Instead of first pushing a key onto the stack, performing the calculation and then making an association, effectively like this

```ps
/size
.
.
.
lines and lines of code to calculate a value
.
.
.
def
```

You could rearrange that into

```ps
.
.
.
lines and lines of code to calculate a value
.
.
.
/size exch def
```

This way the key is closer to the definition, which could aid in understanding.

## Exercises
1. You made a PostScript program that draws a house in the "Hello, World!"-chapter. Introduce some variables into your program that allows you to manipulate the shape of the house by changing the values.
2. The dimensions for an A4 sheet of paper are 210 millimeters by 297 millimeters. Create a program that binds variables to these numbers.
